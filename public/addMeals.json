    "description": "Like yogurt, I always have cottage cheese in my fridge since it's such an easy source of protein. Sometimes I add it to my frittatas or waffles or make it the base of a breakfast bowl . Whisking cottage cheese into my scrambled eggs is almost too simple but definitely worth sharing. This is a great recipe for people who don't like the taste of cottage cheese, but want to incorporate it into your meals because you can't taste it.\\n\\nTips for perfect scrambled eggs\n\nnPan: Use a nonstick pan sprayed with oil to ensure that the eggs don't stick.\\nCottage Cheese: Any brand of cottage cheese will work, but my favorite is Good Culture's low-fat cottage cheese.\n\nCooking: Use a rubber spatula to gently fold the eggs over for about one and a half to two minutes until they are just set.\n\nnHow to serve\\nServe the eggs with whole grain toast and fresh berries.\nWrap them in a tortilla to make breakfast tacos or burritos.\\nMake breakfast sliders by putting the eggs in small potato buns. Add breakfast sausage or bacon for extra protein.\n\nFinish off your eggs with your favorite toppings for a breakfast bowl.\\nSCRAMBLED EGG WITH COTTAGE CHEESE VARIATIONS:\\nSeasoning: Use different spices to change the flavors. For example, season with garlic and onion powders and dried basil and oregano for Italian or chili powder and cumin for Mexican.\n\nVeggies: Add spinach, mushrooms, or bell peppers to the eggs.Recipe Size: Double the recipe if you�re serving more people or halve it if you only need one serving.\"\n"

Spoon in the cider vinegar and allow to sizzle away. Tip in the tomatoes, then measure in a third of a can of water. Cover and leave to simmer for 10-15 mins until the peppers are tender and the sauce is thick\n\nSTEP 2\n\nMeanwhile, make the pancakes.

    "description": "Instructions: \nIn a large bowl, combine apples, grapes, freekeh (or farro), dates, walnuts, and cranberries. \n\nIn a medium bowl, combine yogurt, sugar, water, cinnamon, salt, and vanilla, stirring to combine thoroughly.\n\nPour dressing over fruit and nut mixture, stirring again to combine.\\nServe immediately, or cover and refrigerate until serving.\\nNotes\\nFreekeh and farro: Cook grains according to manufacturer's directions on package (the exact time this takes varies depending upon the grain). To yield 2 cups of cooked grains for this recipe, you will need about 2/3 cup of uncooked grains. Manufacturers vary in how much water they will tell you to use for cooking, as some companies expect all the water will be absorbed during cooking, while other companies have you drain off the excess water after cooking. In our tests, we found that it worked to cook 2/3 cup of either grain in 2 cups of water, draining the excess water after cooking.\n\nBrown sugar: Different brands of vanilla Greek yogurt vary significantly in the amount of sugar they contain and how sweet or tart they taste, which can cause variances in how much brown sugar you'll want to add to this recipe. We find that 1/4 cup of brown sugar in this recipe is a good middle ground, but you can certainly adjust that slightly according to your tastes and how sweet or tart your vanilla Greek yogurt is.\\n\\nMake-ahead tips: To make this salad even easier to throw together, you can cook the grains, and also mix up the dressing ingredients, a day or two ahead of time. Cover both and refrigerate separately until finishing the recipe. Also, as we noted in the post, this salad keeps beautifully in the refrigerator for several days. The dates will become a bit less prominent and meld with the sauce to make it more caramel-y, but either freshly made or refrigerated ahead of time, it's delicious and vibrant.\\n\\nNutrition Information: YIELD: 29 servings SERVING SIZE: 1/2 cup \n\nAmount Per Serving: CALORIES: 118TOTAL FAT: 3gSATURATED FAT: 0gTRANS FAT: 0gUNSATURATED FAT: 2gCHOLESTEROL: 0mgSODIUM: 23mgCARBOHYDRATES: 23gFIBER: 3gSUGAR: 17gPROTEIN: 2g\""

I have countless food magazines, cookbooks and I'm a big stalker of food blogs too. ??\n\nI came across this recipe from Lauren's blog Tastes Better From Scratch awhile ago.

I printed the recipe the minute I saw it and knew they were going to be awesome. ??\n\nChicken Broccoli Alfredo Shells\\nShredded chicken and broccoli are combined with the sauce and stuffed inside jumbo pasta shells. So quick, easy and so good! It was one tasty dinner and the leftovers the next day were even better!\n\nFriends, I thought these turned out so yummy, and my family loved them too.
